# Create-Notes
It's just like a blog application. but here it's intended as a place where users can write there diaries. And there entries are safe since a log in system is also there.

This application is primarily made with the help of Swing that is a Java graphical user interface (GUI). For database I've used MySQL Workbench. :)

It contains 4 pages:
1. Login page:-
It asks for username and password, if credentials are correct, welcome page gets opened.

2. Welcome page:-
It is simply a greeting page, there is a WELCOME message and there you can click on NEXT button and move to next page.

3. Notes page:-
In this page you can access the previously written notes, by selecting the respective dates at which it got saved. Here you have a button to create new notes. Log-out button is also there. It also shows the username of the user.

4. Display notes page:-
On selecting the heading, it opens the full note.

5. Create notes page:-
User can give heading and the body and the note gets saved.
